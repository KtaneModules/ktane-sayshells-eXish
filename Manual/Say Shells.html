                <h2>On the Subject of Say Shells</h2>
                <p class="flavour-text">Don’t get your tongue tied now.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The Say Shells module consists of a display and five buttons.</li>
                    <li>The buttons and display should be blank. If they aren’t, you are looking at a different module.</li>
                    <li>To solve this module you must complete 3 stages. These stages can be completed in any order.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Stage 1</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>This stage uses a phrase from Sea Shells. You can view the phrase by pressing the top left button.</li>
                    <li>Go to the Sea Shells manual and get the sequence of words for this phrase.</li>
                    <li>Press the top right button to enter submission mode for this stage. Pressing any other button will exit submission mode.</li>
                    <li>Enter the sequence of words you received by saying it. What the module interprets will appear on the display.</li>
                    <li>Once the display contains the sequence of words, press the top right button again to submit.</li>
                    <li>Submitting the wrong sequence of words will result in a strike and a reset of this stage.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Stage 2</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>This stage is the same as stage 1 with a few exceptions:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Money Game is used instead of Sea Shells.</li>
                            <li>Each button has a hidden label. If the phrase is being shown, then hovering over a button will show it’s label on the display.</li>
                            <li>The middle buttons are used instead of the top buttons.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Stage 3</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>This stage uses a phrase from either Sea Shells or Money Game. You can view the phrase by pressing the bottom button.</li>
                    <li>Say the phrase exactly as it appears. The module will then highlight words said correctly in green and words said incorrectly in red.</li>
                    <li>If any of the words were red, you must reset the stage by pressing the bottom button before trying again.</li>
                </ul>
